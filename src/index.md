## General Rules Questions

### How does Resistance to Burn work? Does it halve the end of turn damage *twice*?
It does not. Burn actually has **two components**: burn *damage* and *marked burn*[^1]. Resistance halves *damage*, so you will still *mark* the full amount of burn on your sheet.

For example, if you take 4 Burn and somehow have Resistance to it, you will take **2 burn damage**, but you will still mark **4 burn** on your sheet. If you then fail the end-of-turn Engineering check, you will take **half of your marked burn**, which would be **2**, unless you no longer have Resistance to the damage.

*(Note that end-of-turn burn "loses its source", so resistance that depends on the origin of the attack such as Brace or the Tortuga's HyperDense Armor would not apply to it).*
