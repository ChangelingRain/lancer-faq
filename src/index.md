## Page 55, Get Focused
### Can I use the Get Focused downtime action to improve Triggers such as Assault or Apply Fists to Faces, or can it only be used to improve the new Triggers created using Get Focused?
The latter. Get Focused cannot be used to improve the ranks of Triggers that it was not used to create.

## Page 62, Splitting Up Movement
### If I choose to split up movement in a way that I move into an enemy's threat range, pause to attack them, and then continue my movement afterward, does that count as beginning a movement in their threat for the purpose of triggering Overwatch?
Yes.

## Page 65, Invisibility
### Does Invisibility work against tech attacks? Do Reliable weapons deal their damage on a miss when the miss is caused by Invisibility? Are area-of-effect weapons affected by Invisibility?
Invisibility in Lancer is fairly straightforward. All incoming attacks, whether they're ranged, melee, or tech, have a 50% chance to miss before the attack roll is made. This applies to area-of-effect attacks just as much as single target attacks. If an attack made against an Invisible target misses due to the 50% miss chance, that is a miss and it triggers any effects that may be activated on a miss, including Reliable damage.

## Page 67, Harm
### Do half-damage effects stack? (e.g. Heavy Gunner, HyperDense Armor)
They do not stack. "Dealing half damage" is a binary state, similar to Resistance.

### Does the Saladin's Paracausal Mod bypass half-damage effects?
It does not -- the halved damage from effects such as Heavy Gunner is not a *reduction* like Resistance is; it happens "before" step 1 of damage calculations.

### How does Resistance to Burn work? Does it halve the end of turn damage *twice*?
It does not. Resistance to Burn only affects the initial damage, and not the end-of-turn ticks. If you take 4 Burn and resist it, you will take 2 Burn damage and mark 2 Burn stacks, but you will take 2 Burn damage if you fail the EOT check.


## Page 70, Skirmish
### When Skirmishing (or Barraging) in a way that grants bonus attacks with auxiliary weapons, such as with a Main/Aux mount, can I choose to attack with the bonus auxiliary attack first before the attack with the primary weapon?
Yes. When you make an attack with a Skirmish or Barrage that grants a bonus auxiliary weapon attack you can choose the order those weapons attack in. However, bonus auxiliary weapon attacks will still not deal bonus damage even if they come first.<wot:426288556902842368/678782825541140499>

## Page 71, Barrage
### Can I Barrage using the same weapon twice?
No.

## Page 97, Hunter
### Can I use Disdainful Blade to throw the same auxiliary melee weapon I used to hit a character with and trigger the ability in the first place?
Yes.

## Page 102, Tactician
### Do I get the Solar Backdrop benefit for attacking at a higher elevation if my mech is a larger size than the target I'm shooting at?
No, Solar Backdrop doesn't care about relative mech size/height, only whether your position on the map is a higher elevation than the target you're shooting at. Measure from your feet, not from your head.

## Page 105, Loading
### Can I reload weapons with the Loading tag that haven't been fired to trigger effects that apply when reloading weapons?
No, a Loading weapon that hasn't been fully expended cannot be reloaded until it requires it.

## Page 105, Ordnance
### The Ordnance tag reads "This weapon can only be fired before the user moves or takes any other actions on their turn." Does this mean you cannot use Ordnance weapons outside of your turn, such as with Heavy Gunner?
This is a slight misprint. Ordnance should read " This weapon can only be fired before the user moves or takes any other actions on a turn." Ordnance weapons can be used outside of your turn with various reactions (except for Overwatch which is explicitly disallowed) as long as you abide by the tag's other restrictions.

## Page 130, IPS-N Blackbeard
### When I critically hit with a Chain Axe, does the Shredded effect apply before or after the weapon's damage?
You can choose to apply on hit or on crit effects in whatever order you choose, including before damage from the attack in question. So when you critically hit with a Chain Axe you can choose to apply the Shredded condition to the target before dealing damage, preventing them from benefitting from armor or resistance.

### When I activate the SEKHMET Protocol, do I continue to take turns as normal or do I hand over control to the GM?
SEKHMET Protocol doesn't hand over control of your mech to the GM as if your NHP was cascading. Narratively SEKHMET may be in "control" of things but you, the player, are still playing, it's just you have a series of restrictions and conditions on what actions and maneuvers you can try to take. You still control the mech and can make decisions within those restrictions as you like.

## Page 132, IPS-N Drake
### Does the Drake's Guardian trait mean it provides soft cover against attacks that would be obstructed by it even if an ally isn't adjacent to it, as per the guidelines for Checking For Cover on page 66?
No. Any mech with the Guardian trait (and the Barbarossa's Colossus trait) only provide cover to allies who are adjacent to them, they do not act as actual pieces of environmental hard cover for the purpose of the Checking For Cover guidelines.

## Page 144, IPS-N Raleigh
### If at the end of my turn I reload my weapons due to the Full Metal Jacket trait, can I then use that reload as a trigger to fire the M35 Mjolnir as a free action even though the FMJ reload is at the end of my turn?
Yes.

## Page 148, IPS-N Tortuga
### If I use Throughbolt Rounds on a weapon that has a Burst range/AoE type, such as the Bristlecrown Flechette Launcher, does the Burst retain the size it would have if measured from the mech or does it measure its size from the endpoint of the Throughbolt Round's line?
The latter. Bursts always measure their size from the targeted point. If a Burst is centered on a mech then you use that as the point of origin, but if launched away from the mech such as with Throughbolt Rounds the Burst will use the end of the line as its center point instead.

## Page 176, SSC Monarch
### If I position the two Blast areas of a Pinaka Missiles attack so that they both hit a size 2 or size 3 target without overlapping, does this hit that target twice?
No. The Pinaka Missiles are still treated as a single attack, just one with a custome area-of-effect that consists of two Blast areas. Even if you place both Blasts in a way that they could hit a single target without overlapping, you still only roll to hit that target once.

## Page 192, HORUS Balor
### If the Balor's Regeneration trait is disabled from taking stress or structure damage, when it reactivates at the end of the next turn do you then also regenerate HP at the end of that turn as well?
No, when the Regeneration trait is disabled you do not regain any HP at the end of your next turn, even though both reactivating the trait and regaining HP happen "at the end of your next turn." The trait simply reactivates. The next opportunity you'll have to regain HP with the Regeneration trait will be end of the turn after that.

## Page 196, HORUS Goblin
### Does the Autopod count as an attack and/or a hit for the purpose of things that trigger off attacks or hits, such as the Stormbringer talent?
Yes, the Autopod's Autonomous Assault reaction is considered an attack which automatically hits.

## Page 210, HORUS Manticore
### Is there any way at all I can activate CASTIGATE THE ENEMIES OF THE GODHEAD without being physically present in the mech itself at the time of detonation? A subaltern with a copy of my neural pattern? A clone? A brick on the accelerator? My long lost twin sibling, who I don't like very much? A service animal? Anything?
No.

## Page 218, HORUS Pegasus
### What does Â¿%:?EXTR!UDE GUN actually do?
GUN: GUN

## Page 226, HA Barbarossa
### If I fire the Siege Cannon in Siege Mode, can I switch to Direct Fire mode and continue attacking without reloading it first since only Siege Mode has the Loading tag?
No, once a weapon has been used in a way that requires reloading in needs to be reloaded before it can be attacked with again in any mode or configuration it may have.

## Page 234, HA Iskander
### When the Iskander uses its Mine Deployers trait, do these additional deployed mines also consume charges from the system being used?
Yes.

### Is the Gravity Gun affected by Invisibility?
No. The Gravity Gun's use is, technically speaking, an attack. If your mech is unable to make attacks for some reason, such as being Jammed, it cannot use the Gravity Gun. But the actual effect of the Gravity Gun when you attack with it is one that has no associated to hit roll of any sort, functioning instead more like a grenade or mine, and so there's no way for it to "miss" like a regular attack would, even if the target is Invisible. This also means that the Gravity Gun does not benefit from anything that would trigger on hit or on crit since it can do neither of those things.

## Page 241, HA Napoleon
### If I create a Blinkshield, can I create another Blinkshield within it before the first one expires?
The Blinkshield can't be crossed with any effect, and that includes another Blinkshield. If you attempt to create a Blinkshield within a Blinkshield and any part of the two shields overlap or intersect, you cannot do so as it would violate the clause that states that no effect can cross the Blinkshield.

## Page 246, HA Sherman
### Can I repeatedly Stabilize outside of combat to add charges to the ZF4 Solidcore?
No. Strictly speaking, combat actions such as Stabilize don't really "exist" outside of combat. When resting or during downtime the Stabilize action isn't something you take, you have other options for repairing your mech available to you, the same way that if you were looking to use your mech to shoot at a guard tower during a narrative scene you wouldn't declare "I use a Skirmish," you would simply state your intent to shoot the tower.
