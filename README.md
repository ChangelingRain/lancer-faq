# Lancer FAQ
FAQ/errata page for Massif Press's LANCER tabletop RPG. Generated from Markdown. Any contributions are welcome.

## Contributing
The page is generated from the [index.md](/src/index.md) Markdown file. Markdown is quite simple to learn and requires no coding experience. You can see a cheat sheet for the syntax [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

You'll need a GitHub account to make contributions. Once you have one, you can just use [this link](https://github.com/aritsune/lancer-faq/edit/master/src/index.md) to edit the index & generate a pull request for it.

### Guidelines

If your FAQ answer cannot be sourced from the book but is a ruling provided by Massif on the discord, please make sure to include a "Word of Tom" source by using the `<wot:...>` special syntax. You need to include the last 2 numbers of the link provided by the "Copy Message Link" context menu option, for example: `<wot:441336855951048725/671778019928440862>`.

Feel free to include yourself into the [contributors.txt](https://github.com/aritsune/lancer-faq/blob/master/src/contributors.txt) file when you make a PR.
